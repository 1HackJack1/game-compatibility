# game-compatibility
If your favorite game isn't working on Xenia, the best way to prioritize it would be to
find it in the game compatibility list and give the OP a **thumbs up reaction**. This allows
the developers to find popular games quickly.

If you've looked in the list and you couldn't find your game - see the following section:

## Submitting Issues
If you would like to submit a game-compatibility issue, please use the following format until a proper solution is available:

Title: {UNIQUE GAME ID} - {GAME NAME}

Content to include:
* Marketplace link
* A reference to the version of xenia tested on
* A short description of how the game runs or any issues
* A log file (run xenia with "xenia default.xex --log_file=output.log" and either attach a *compressed* output.log to the issue, or upload output.log to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/))
* If you can: Checklist or standard list of issues
* If you don't have the ability to add labels to your issue, please comment which labels should be added. (gotta love the github contributor system)
